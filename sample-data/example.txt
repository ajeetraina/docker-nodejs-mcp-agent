# Sample Data File

This is a sample file that the MCP filesystem server can read.

## Project Information
- Name: Simple Node.js MCP Agent
- Version: 1.0.0
- Purpose: Demonstrate MCP integration with local models

## Available MCP Tools
1. DuckDuckGo Search - for web searches
2. Filesystem - for reading and listing files

## Usage Examples
Try asking the agent:
- "What's in this file?"
- "List all files in the sample-data directory"
- "Search for information about MCP"

The agent will use the appropriate MCP tool to help you!

## Architecture
The agent works by:
1. Receiving user queries via web interface
2. Analyzing the query to determine which MCP tool to use
3. Calling the appropriate MCP server through the gateway
4. Processing the results with a local AI model (qwen3)
5. Returning intelligent responses to the user

## Fun Facts
- This entire project is less than 200 lines of code!
- It demonstrates the power of MCP for tool integration
- Docker Model Runner provides local AI inference
- Everything runs in containers for easy deployment
